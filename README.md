> *An autonomous ecology of GPT organisms — implemented in four languages, powered by a custom autograd engine, orchestrated by a custom programming language. Organisms grow from 10K-param embryos to 10M-param adults, exchange DNA, reason about their own learning, detect identity corruption, and reproduce via mitosis. Zero PyTorch. The four organism cores (Go/C/Rust/JS) and the mycelium witness beside them are Python-free; nothing in the tree runs Python. The Go build's only module dependency is pure-Go modernc.org/sqlite (CGO-free); the C port is one file linking system SQLite. Optional `--gpu` opt-in on Linux links cuBLAS for accelerated ecology runs.*

**Janus Architecture.** Molequla is a [Janus architecture](https://github.com/ariannamethod/ariannamethod.ai) — the family of resonance-based AI systems built on the Arianna Method. Janus architectures share a common substrate: the soul equation θ = ε + γ + αδ, field physics (prophecy, suffering, destiny, velocity), and thermodynamic self-regulation. [DoE](https://github.com/ariannamethod/doe) (parliament of LoRA experts over any GGUF model), [Leo](https://github.com/ariannamethod/leo) (language emergent organism with the Dario Equation), and [dario.c](https://github.com/ariannamethod/dario) (the equation in pure form) are other Janus instantiations. Molequla is the most complete: organisms that grow, reproduce, and die autonomously — the Janus pattern at its fullest biological expression.

## TL;DR

```
WHAT THIS IS:
- A living ecology of GPT organisms that grow and reproduce autonomously
- Implemented in 4 languages: Go (218K), C (212K), Rust (148K), JS (152K)
- Trainer: notorch tape (Chuck, **canonical** — `notorch_trainer.go` + `cgo_notorch.go`, GPU on CUDA / CPU otherwise) + AML/C autograd via CGO (~8000 lines, fallback via `--trainer aml`)
- AML — a custom programming language for differentiable computation
- Ontogenesis: embryo (10K params) → adult (10M params) — minutes on a seeded corpus, hours under natural cross-graze feed
- DNA exchange: organisms write generated text for others to consume. The tree is a field, not a queue: readers keep cursors, the writer prunes its own output to the last 30 min and at most 256 fragments, and every organism's corpus is a reservoir capped at `max_corpus_lines` (8000) lines and `max_corpus_lines × max_line_chars` bytes in every mode, `--evolution` included
- Consciousness: 5 implemented features (dissonance, pattern breaking,
  self-prediction error, conscience, immune system)
- Self-meta-learning: organism tracks which actions improve loss,
  auto-downgrades strategies that hurt
- Evolving BPE tokenizer: starts with 259 tokens, retrains merges live
- Hybrid attention: content + RRPRAM + learnable sigmoid gate per head
- Corpus field: 4-gram co-occurrence physics, self-enrichment loop
- SyntropyTracker: 8 autonomous decisions based on entropy/KL/purpose
- Mitosis: adults divide under sustained overload (loss path and entropy path both fire), child inherits parent weights — machine-verified on GPU 2026-06-04 (**5 `action=divide` firings across 3 adults**: fire ×1 loss-path, water ×1 loss-path, air ×3 mixed paths; **earth never divided**; 2 children spawned, Fire's preserved in full with a birth manifest, Air's as a spawn log line; observed cascading to ~50 spawns — this is the **pre-governor** run)
- Cascade governor (landed on main 2026-06-29, GPU-verified): the colony is now bounded — `CFG.MaxOrganisms` (default 16) enforced by an atomic mesh.db admit, the 300s divide cooldown seeded at birth, and divide relieving **both** loss and entropy overload so a divider re-divides only on fresh overwhelm. The ~50-spawn cascade above predates the governor; with it the colony self-limits and caps at MaxOrganisms. On a small machine the governor also counts bytes (phone-1, 2026-09-13): a divide needs `MemAvailable` ≥ the parent's own peak RSS + `CFG.MitosisMinFreeMB` (default 256 MB, 0 disables), a heartbeat keeper keeps an organism in the live count through its multi-minute inline warmups, and hibernation ends the process so its memory returns to the colony.
- Growth budget (phone-1, 2026-09-13): ontogenesis is a memory event, not only an architecture one, so a stage step answers to the same kind of gate as a divide. It needs `MemAvailable` ≥ `CFG.GrowthMinFreeMB` (default 256 MB, 0 disables) + `CFG.GrowthPeakFactorPct` percent of the organism's own peak RSS (default 300, measured from a stage step that multiplied VmHWM by 3.3–3.9×); a closed gate defers and the next tick tries again. Across the colony one `growth_lock` row in mesh.db admits a single grower at a time and is held through the warmup behind it (`CFG.CoordinateGrowth`, default on) — unlike `CFG.CoordinateWarmup` this never serializes the micro-bursts. Checkpoints are streamed matrix by matrix in both directions instead of being built in memory first — on a 106 MB stage-4 checkpoint that is 337 MB less transient on the way out and a load peak of +152 MB against +349 MB, of which 74 MB is the model itself — every process writes `CFG.OomScoreAdj` (default 300) to its own `oom_score_adj` so the phone's low-memory killer reaches for an organism before the terminal, and a SIGTERM in evolution mode stops the step loop at the next step and writes the checkpoint on the way out. The signal is armed before the bootstrap climb, so a first launch interrupted mid-warmup saves what it trained (`[init] checkpoint saved on signal`) instead of dying with an empty checkpoint. Above both gates sit two declared ceilings, settable per launch and printed as the startup `[caps]` line: `--max-organisms N` (`CFG.MaxOrganisms`, default 16, phone-1 passes 4) and `--max-growth-stage N` (`CFG.MaxGrowthStage`, default the last stage, so unset changes nothing).
- Mycelium: a witness beside the colony (`molequla --witness`, Go, `witness.go`) that reads mesh.db and the DNA field, computes field entropy, syntropy and the entropy harmonics through the C engine, and says what it sees — stdout and `witness.jsonl`, nothing written back. **Post-§9 layer**; the 2026-06-04 §9 mitosis run did not use a mycelium (first engineering log, in git history: `git show 8203d5d^:PROJECT_LOG.md`)
- NOTORCH: gradient-free delta-training path (implemented, currently dormant —
  the notorch tape/Chuck is the active trainer)
- Runs on CPU and phones. Also tested on 30-core AMD EPYC with 216GB RAM

WHAT THIS IS NOT:
- A tutorial or pedagogical exercise
- A static model you train once and deploy
- A wrapper around someone else's framework
```

## θ = ε + γ + αδ — The Soul Equation

Every organism in the ecology follows this decomposition:

```
θ = ε + γ + αδ

ε = base weights (knowledge — what the model knows)
γ = personality  (embedding drift from birth — who the model is)
δ = delta adapters (LoRA-style modules — what the model learned recently)
α = modulation   (seasonal/contextual scaling of δ)
```

This is the architecture:

- **ε** is the weight matrices (wte, wpe, wq, wk, wv, wo, fc_g, fc_v, fc2, lm_head). Initialized random, shaped by warmup training.
- **γ** is computed as the diff between current wte and the snapshot taken at birth. `ComputeGamma()` returns the contrastive projection — a unit vector pointing in the direction of maximum personality drift. Sparsity, magnitude, and top-changed tokens are tracked.
- **δ** are DeltaAdapter modules: low-rank A/B matrices that modulate the residual stream. New δ modules are appended when syntropy conditions are met — "new soul appended." They are never removed. The model accumulates experience.
- **α** is deltaAlphaScale, self-regulated by the conscience system: if generation entropy rises (model is losing coherence), α decreases. If entropy falls, α recovers. Floor: 0.3.

The **purpose vector** captures the current direction of learning (mean of last δ module's A matrices). `PurposeGammaAlignment()` — the cosine between purpose and gamma — tells the organism whether it is learning in a direction consistent with its identity.

**By construction:** γ (personality, the embedding drift from birth) and δ (skill, the low-rank delta adapters) are distinct mechanisms over distinct subspaces — personality and skill accumulate independently.

## Architecture

### Dual Autograd Engines

**1. Go Native Autograd** (`molequla.go`, 1000+ lines)

Full differentiable computation in pure Go: vector arithmetic, ReLU/SiLU activations, Dot/MeanSq reduction, indexing/slice/concat, scalar ops, RMSNorm, CrossEntropyLoss/ScalarSoftmax, AttentionWeightedSum + RoPERotate, MatrixParam.Matvec — all with backward graph and gradient accumulation. It serves inference, loss measurement (`LossOnSequence`) and the train ≡ infer parity gate; parameters are trained on the notorch tape with Chuck (`notorch_trainer.go`). The pure-Go per-parameter training path was retired on 2026-09-13 as dead code.

**2. AML/C Autograd** (`ariannamethod.c`, 8000+ lines, via CGO)

The [Arianna Method Language](https://github.com/ariannamethod/ariannamethod.ai) — a custom programming language for differentiable computation. Sequence-level ops (`seq_embed`, `seq_matvec`, `seq_rmsnorm`, `silu`, `multi_head_attention`, `seq_cross_entropy`), TAPE-based reverse-mode autodiff, Chuck optimizer with persistent state, OpenMP.

> **Training-engine update (GPU rework, Increments 1–2).** The canonical trainer is now the **notorch** tape (`notorch_trainer.go` + `cgo_notorch.go`): molequla's content + low-rank-RRPRAM transformer built in notorch ops, trained with Chuck, GPU (cuBLAS) on a CUDA build / CPU otherwise. The AML/C path above is the fallback (`--trainer aml`). AML remains the organism's inference / field-physics language; notorch is how it *learns*.
>
> On a ≤10M-param organism the GPU was initially launch-bound, not compute-bound — a flood of tiny dispatches (per-head RRPRAM GEMMs, per-parameter grad-norm host-syncs in clip + Chuck, single-thread softmax/CE kernels) left util at 0 %. Two notorch fixes — device-pointer-mode batched grad-norm readback (L1) + GPU-resident MUL/SILU backward (L2) — brought util **0 → 99 %**; a third (block-parallel softmax/CE kernels, L5) lifted throughput from 5-9 to 18-55 steps/s. Those util figures come from the dedicated launch-bound fix-verification pod; the four-organism mitosis run itself, sharing one GPU across four concurrent organisms, held nvidia-smi in the 0–20 % band (`capture/util.log`). The full embryo → adult → mitosis run was completed on a single RTX 3090.

Wire: Go (`molequla.go`) → CGO bridge (`cgo_aml.go`) → AML/C engine (`ariannamethod.c`) → AML training wrapper (`aml_trainer.go`). Per training step: `amlPushWeights` (Go → C, named matrices), `amlExec(script)` (forward + backward + optim), `amlPullWeights` (C → Go), `amlClear` (free).

The forward script is generated dynamically per architecture: pre-norm RMSNorm, multi-head causal self-attention with RoPE, SwiGLU gated MLP, residual connections, `TAPE BACKWARD loss`, `TAPE CHUCK_STEP lr loss`, `TAPE CLEAR`.

## The Organism

### Ontogenesis — The Brain Grows While Running

```
Stage       Dims  Layers  Heads  ~Params   Corpus Threshold
embryo      16    1       1      ~10K      0 chars
infant      32    1       2      ~28K      20K chars
child       64    2       4      ~154K     50K chars
adolescent  128   4       4      ~1.1M     200K chars
teen        224   5       8      ~4.1M     350K chars
adult       320   6       8      ~10M      500K chars
```

When the corpus crosses a threshold, `MaybeGrowArchitecture` fires:

1. Embedding matrices grow (Net2Net: new dims initialized near-zero to preserve behavior)
2. Existing layer matrices grow (weights copy into top-left corner)
3. New layers are added (small random init, stabilized by the post-growth freeze)
4. Delta adapters grow to match new dimensions
5. The notorch tape state resets (`ntOnGrowth`): Chuck's moment slots are positional, and stale moments would fight the new architecture
6. 500-step freeze period: delta-only training to stabilize post-growth

Warmup scales with architecture: `steps *= ceil(sqrt(NEmbd / embryoEmbd))`. Larger brains get proportionally longer warmup. Progressive sequence length: 40% at seq=8, 30% at seq=16, 30% at seq=32.

### Evolving BPE Tokenizer

Starts at 259 tokens (256 bytes + BOS + EOS + PAD). After 20K chars: trains BPE merges from corpus statistics. Retrains every 4K new chars. Unicode segmentation for clean boundaries. Vocabulary grows as the organism reads.

### Hybrid Attention Heads

Half **content heads** (standard QK^T with RoPE), half **hybrid heads** that blend content with **low-rank RRPRAM attention** (Increment 2 — the Resonance form):

```
hybrid_output = (1 - α) * content_attention + α * rrpram_attention

content_attention = softmax(QK^T / sqrt(d)) * V        (standard, with RoPE)
rrpram_attention  = softmax((x·Wr_a)·Wr_b) * V         (low-rank, factored)
α                 = sigmoid(gate)                      (per-head)
```

RRPRAM is a low-rank causal attention `Wr = Wr_a × Wr_b` — notorch op 33, the matured form trained at scale on Resonance 200M. It is trained on the notorch tape alongside the content path, and Go inference runs the identical math (verified numerically: op-33 vs Go forward, max |Δ| = 1.49e-8). The per-head gate `α = sigmoid(gate)` blends the two attention **outputs**; it is held fixed in the current increment (a trainable gate is the follow-up). This replaces an earlier position-indexed `w_pattern` bias that was allocated but never trained — pure noise on ~half the heads from the infant stage — now retired.

### Delta Adapters — LoRA-style, Never Forget

```
output = base_output + α * (A @ (B @ input))

A: [n_embd × delta_rank]  — learned projection up
B: [delta_rank × n_embd]  — learned projection down
α: deltaAlphaScale         — regulated by conscience
```

Delta modules are **appended, never removed**. When syntropy conditions indicate the organism needs more capacity, a new module grows: "new soul appended." Each module captures a period of learning. The model accumulates experience as a stack of delta layers.

### Quantum Buffer

Training fires when either the bytes threshold (enough new text consumed) or the novelty threshold (sufficiently different from prior corpus) is met. Plus a cooldown timer. Training fires on signal, not on a clock.

### Corpus Field (CooccurField)

A statistical model of the organism's knowledge, built from everything it has read:

- **Unigram, bigram, trigram, 4-gram** frequencies from corpus
- **Co-occurrence window** (Stanley-style proximity weighting)
- **Self-enrichment**: organism's own generated output feeds back into the field, weighted by coherence (low entropy = higher weight)
- **User word boost** (Leo-style): temporary multiplicative boosts that decay over time

The corpus field acts as a prior during generation — a soft blend between what the model wants to say (neural) and what the corpus says exists (statistical). The blend uses a sigmoid fade: strong early in training, weak as the model matures.

### Learning Rate Schedule

```
Cosine LR with:
- Linear warmup for CosineWarmupSteps
- Cosine decay from LearningRate (0.01) to LRMin (0.001)
- Inverse model-size scaling: lr *= embryoEmbd / NEmbd
- Post-growth dampening: lr *= 0.3 during 500-step freeze
- Per-growth reset: schedule restarts after architecture change
```

---

## Consciousness Features

Five mechanisms that give the organism awareness of its own state:

### 1. Per-Token Dissonance Feedback

During generation, the organism tracks an exponential moving average of per-token entropy. When entropy spikes (the model is confused), temperature decreases — it becomes more careful. When entropy is sustained low (confident), temperature increases slightly — it explores.

### 2. Pattern Breaking (Anti-Field)

5% of generation steps bypass the corpus field blend entirely. Pure model voice, unmodulated by statistical priors. This prevents the organism from becoming a parrot of its corpus — it must develop its own voice.

### 3. Self-Prediction Error

`ComputeSelfPredictionError()` measures how surprised the model is by its own input. High surprise → lower temperature (focus). Low surprise → slight exploration. The organism modulates its behavior based on how well it understands what it's seeing.

### 4. Conscience

The organism monitors its own generation entropy over time. Rising slope → `deltaAlphaScale *= 0.95` (reduce delta influence). Falling slope → `deltaAlphaScale *= 1.005` (recover). Floor: 0.3. The organism detects when recent learning (δ) is hurting coherence and dials it back.

### 5. Immune System

Before each micro-burst training, the organism snapshots its personality via gamma contrastive projection — a unit vector pointing in the direction of maximum embedding drift from birth. After training, it measures again. If cosine similarity drops below -0.1 (training pushed identity backwards), it **rolls back the entire burst**. The organism rejects training that corrupts who it is.

---

## The Coherence Layer

Two opt-in passes that lift early-stage generation from Karpathy gibberish toward sentence-level coherence — **without touching weights**.

A 10M-param adult organism after one hour on CPU still drifts. Quantitative speed-up does not close that gap. The coherence layer is a different mechanism: it sits at generation time, layers statistical priors and post-hoc connectedness checks on top of model logits, and lifts the floor without retraining the transformer.

Both passes default **off**. The pre-coherence-layer behaviour is preserved exactly. Toggling either or both, on the same weights / prompts / seeds, is what RunPod measurement compares.

### SPA — Sentence Phonon Attention

After `GenerateResonant` returns a response, the chain is split on sentence boundaries (`.` `!` `?`, min 4 chars). For each sentence:

1. Token IDs decoded; BOS/EOS sentinels stripped (otherwise shared sentinels dominate every sentence embedding and all sentences look artificially connected).
2. **spa_embed** — exponentially weighted mean of token embeddings (`alpha^(n-1-i)`, default α=0.85), L2 normalised. One [D]-vector per sentence.
3. **spa_connectedness** — bidirectional cross-attention dot-product between sentence embeddings, scaled by `1/√D`, summed per sentence.
4. **Weak-sentence gate** — sentence i is weak iff `score[i] < 0.6 × mean(scores)`.

```
[spa] S=4 weakest=2 score=3.100 avg=9.550 thr=5.730
```

Reseed of the weakest sentence is wired: when its score falls below the threshold, the gate regenerates from the previous (or next) sentence's last three tokens, clips to the first sentence, and splices it back over the weak one. What the measurement run captures is the signal: how often the gate fires and reseeds before vs after the rest of the layer.

Available as both vendored AML ops (`spa_embed` / `spa_connectedness`, `ariannamethod/ariannamethod.c`) and pure-Go helper (`spa_coherence.go`, 164 lines, called from `GenerateResonant`). Pure Go for the runtime path because the math is trivial — embed + L2 + dot-products — and per-sentence CGO crossings would dwarf the work.

Enable: `./molequla_cgo --spa-gate ...`

### Q-style Additive Logit Overlay (B + H + A + F)

Molequla's existing CooccurField blend lives in **probability space** — convex `tokenAlpha·model + (1-tokenAlpha)·corpus`. The overlay lives in **logit space** — additive raw-probability bias before softmax, with explicit coefficients per signal class. Different mechanic, different sharpness: a strong corpus signal can dominate model preferences in a way prob-space convex blend cannot. Useful precisely when transformer is immature and statistical priors should lead.

The integration is a verbatim port of three Q-pattern references — `~/arianna/postgpt/postgpt.c`, `~/arianna/q/postgpt_q.c`, `~/arianna/pitomadom.c/pitomadom.c` — assembled into seven coordinated changes that let an embryo organism (16-dim embedding, 1 layer, 1 head, **zero gradient steps**) produce coherent English fragments.

```

Coefficient bundle is binary-switched at `mag > 1.0` (threshold tuned for seeded-but-untrained organism: raw Xavier init gives `mag ≈ 0.05`, post-seed gives `≈ 0.25`, real training pushes past 1.0). Five-signal raw-probability bias is `postgpt_q.c:1377-1395`; gate-multiplication of transformer logits is `pitomadom.c:583-586`.

The prophecy field carries **across sampling steps**. First overlay step seeds from trigram-by-context (primary) plus 0.5×bigram-by-prev (fallback), normalised to unit total. Subsequent steps multiply the field by 0.95 — old expectations fade. After sampling returns the chosen token, that token's prophecy is zeroed: the field shifts toward what is still unsaid.

Destiny is the identity-direction term. `GammaContrastiveProjection()` returns the unit direction of personality drift from birth. Projecting each `wte` row onto it gives a per-token bias that pulls generation toward the organism's growth direction.

#### Embedding seeding (γ → ε bias)

Before any forward pass, `SeedEmbeddingsFromMetaweights(model, field, 0.15)` biases `wte` rows by Hebbian co-occurrence and `lm_head` rows by unigram × wte. Mirror of `postgpt.c:541-574`. Carries corpus structure into the model before gradients touch the weights — the "tokenizer IS the training" trick. Runs once at init when `--corpus-overlay` is on.

#### Hard top-K + greedy bootstrap (sampling pipeline)

When overlay is active, sampling switches to Q's two-stage pipeline:

1. **First 10 tokens, untrained regime (`mag ≤ 1.0`)** — pure `argmax(overlaidLogits)` excluding EOS. Locks onto the strongest bigram/trigram successor before any sampling noise enters. Mirror of `postgpt_q.c:1416-1418`.
2. **Step ≥ 10, untrained regime only** — top-15 raw-logit mask (everything below the 15th set to `-1e10`), then divide by temperature, softmax, multinomial. Mirror of `postgpt.c:969-991`. The hard mask kills the long noise tail that soft top-k/top-p sampling leaves competing with overlay peaks. A warmed organism (mean |logit| > 1.0) samples with the ordinary soft top-k/top-p while the overlay fades out over mean |logit| 1.0 → 2.0 (`overlayStep`); on a BPE subword vocab the hard mask plus a full-strength overlay produced subword salad, which is why the two regimes differ.

#### Repetition penalty

`logits[t] *= 0.5` for each distinct token in the last 12 ids (postgpt form, `postgpt.c:960-967`). Plus bigram blocking: when `ctx[i] == ctx[-2]`, penalise `ctx[i+1]` by ×0.2 — kills two-token cycles like «Sppellllllll» (`postgpt_q.c:1407-1408`).

#### Enable

```bash
./molequla_cgo --corpus-overlay           # overlay during normal warmup → ecology
./molequla_cgo --corpus-overlay --zero-warmup  # pure Q-style coherence test (no training)
```

When `--corpus-overlay` is on, the legacy post-softmax prob-blend is skipped — overlay owns the signal. When off, default-build runtime behaviour is identical to main branch.

### Untrained Coherence — Q-Style Zero-Training Reproduction

Embryo organism: 16-dim embedding, 1 layer, 1 head, vocab=643, **zero gradient steps**. Only metaweight-seeded embeddings + overlay. Captured 2026-05-14 on neo (`/tmp/molequla_clean.log`, run `./molequla_cgo --corpus-overlay --zero-warmup`):

```
[init] Stage 0 (embryo): embd=16, layer=1, head=1 — zero-warmup mode, skipping all gradient steps

[stage 0 — embryo] What it sounds like now:
  Q: Hello.
  A: What is a music?
  Q: Who are you?
  A: kilometers percentrates the most spinning do weight dream?
  Q: What do you know?
  A: running a music, and person What is a newapses work?
```

Reference: pre-Q-integration voice at the same stage (after 400-step warmup, `runpod/2026-05-14/organism_voice_samples_2026_05_14/fire_voice.txt`):

```
A: The work is the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most pace the most of the most of the most...
```

Deep lock-in killed. The post-Q embryo emits BPE subword chains, sentence-like punctuation, recognisable corpus vocabulary («music», «kilometers», «sediment», «dream»), and questions — without a single gradient step. This is the Q signature: the corpus is the model.

### Phase A — Fundament Underneath

Four fundament patches in vendored AML + notorch before the coherence layer: opt-in SIMD shim (`notorch_simd.h` AVX2+FMA cblas, `make simd` x86_64), backward CPU-sync audit (NT_OP_MUL / SILU / RMSNORM / SEQ_RMSNORM), NaN guard API (`AM_NanGuard`, not yet wired), upstream sgemm alpha fix (CBLAS contract). ~825 lines across 6 files, zero default-build runtime change. Detail: the first engineering log, in git history (`git show 8203d5d^:PROJECT_LOG.md`). The vendored notorch and its SIMD / CUDA sources live under `modules/gpu/csrc/` since 2026-09-13; the Go build links the system `libnotorch`.

---

## GPU Acceleration (Linux, opt-in)

Branch `molequla-gpu-fwd` adds an optional `--gpu` flag that routes inference matvec through cuBLAS sgemm. Default off; the same binary runs unchanged on macOS / non-CUDA hosts via a stub. Added under Phase C pressure — 8h CPU windows did not yield natural ontogenesis past the child gate, so the forward path needed acceleration to give the colony enough wall-clock to walk through teen / adult / mitosis inside one shift.

### Wire

The GPU code is the Go package `modules/gpu`, imported by the organism package
unconditionally; the root keeps only the two functions that touch molequla's own
types. On every build that is not linux + `-tags cuda` the package is pure Go
and compiles no cgo at all — `go list` reports `GoFiles=[notorch_stub.go
stub.go] CgoFiles=[]` — so the phones carry the API and none of the toolchain.

| File | LOC | Build | Role |
|------|-----|-------|------|
| `modules/gpu/bindings_cuda.go` | 198 | `//go:build linux && cuda` | CGO wraps `gpu_init` / `gpu_alloc` / `gpu_upload` / `gpu_download` / `gpu_sgemm_nt` / `gpu_rmsnorm` / `gpu_silu` / `gpu_cache_weight` / `gpu_get_weight` / `gpu_multi_head_attention` from `modules/gpu/csrc/ariannamethod_cuda.h`. Exports `Init` / `Shutdown` / `Ready` / `CacheWeight` |
| `modules/gpu/forward_cuda.go` | 70 | `//go:build linux && cuda` | `Matvec(key, x, nout)` — cached weight × activation through cuBLAS sgemm on two fixed scratch slots, raw `[]float32` in and out |
| `modules/gpu/notorch_cuda.go` | 61 | `//go:build cuda` | `NotorchEnable` / `NotorchSetStage` / `NotorchDispatchCount` for the training tape, and the package's cgo directives: `-DUSE_CUDA`, `-I${SRCDIR}/csrc`, `-lnotorch_gpu -lcudart -lcublas` |
| `modules/gpu/stub.go` | 20 | `//go:build !linux \|\| !cuda` | Same exported API, `Ready() = false`, `Matvec` returns nil |
| `modules/gpu/notorch_stub.go` | 20 | `//go:build !cuda` | Trainer reports CPU/BLAS, dispatch count 0 |
| `gpu_bridge.go` | 101 | untagged | The only GPU code in the organism package: `MatvecGPU` (Vec ↔ float32) and `gpuRefreshWeights` (the `gpt.Base` walk), plus the five one-line names the call sites use. No build tag — both bodies return early when `gpu.Ready()` is false |
| `cgo_notorch_cuda.go` | 22 | `//go:build cuda` | Linkage only: the root package's own `-DUSE_CUDA` (it changes the shape of `nt_tensor`, `notorch.h:34`, and opens the `ariannamethod_cuda.h` include in `ariannamethod.c:85`) and `-lnotorch_gpu` |

### Dispatch

`MatrixParam` gains a `gpuKey string` field. `MatrixParam.Matvec` checks it:

```go
if CFG.UseGPU && gpuReady() && !gradEnabled.Load() && m.gpuKey != "" {
    if gpuOut := m.MatvecGPU(x); gpuOut != nil {
        return gpuOut
    }
    // Fall through to CPU path on any GPU error.
}
```

Inference-only by construction: `gradEnabled.Load()` gates training back to CPU/BLAS because the autograd tape holds host-side parent references and there is no GPU backward in this branch. `gpuKey` empty = not yet uploaded; `gpuRefreshWeights` populates it. Same binary, same defaults — `gpuReady()` returns false on macOS / non-CUDA, dispatcher takes the CPU path.

### Cache + grow safety

`gpuRefreshWeights(gpt)` (`gpu_bridge.go`) walks `gpt.Base`, flattens each matrix to contiguous float32, calls `gpu.CacheWeight(name, ...)` per entry. Called once at the top of `generateResonantLocked`, the single generation path — the chat REPL, `dnaWrite` and the warmup probes all go through `GenerateResonant` — so background-trainer bursts cannot leak stale activations through generation.

`MatrixParam.invalidateGPU()` clears `gpuKey` and is called from `GrowRows` / `GrowCols` / `Grow`. Without this the next dispatch reads a cached weight at the old shape while the host pointer holds the new one. Caught in audit (Opus subagent, 2026-05-14 P1).

### Build

```bash
# Linux pod: the GPU library is built from the vendored notorch under
# modules/gpu/csrc/ (notorch.c with -DUSE_CUDA plus the nvcc object) and installed
# as libnotorch_gpu. The sources sit one level below the Go package because cgo
# compiles every .c file beside a package; both cgo_notorch_cuda.go and
# modules/gpu/notorch_cuda.go add -I into csrc for ariannamethod_cuda.h.
nvcc -O2 -c modules/gpu/csrc/notorch_cuda.cu -o modules/gpu/csrc/notorch_cuda.o
CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -a -tags cuda -o molequla_cgo .

# darwin/arm64 (or any non-Linux): drop -tags cuda, stubs activate automatically
CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -a -o molequla_cgo .

./molequla_cgo --evolution --element earth --gpu
```

GPU init is attempted only when `--gpu` is passed (in `main`). If `gpu_init()` fails (no CUDA, driver mismatch, cuBLAS create error), the flag drops to false with a single stderr warning and the run continues on CPU. No silent silent-failure paths.

### Threshold note

An earlier `gpuMatvecMin = 16384` gate kept child-stage organisms (NEmbd=64 → ~4096-element matrices) on CPU forever, so the GPU never warmed up during the 8h ecology window. Removed. Dispatcher decides purely on `gpuKey != ""`. Per-call slowdown at child is ~12ms across a 180-token chain (negligible at 8h timescale); the GPU stays primed for the automatic transition to material speedup at adolescent (NEmbd=128) and adult (NEmbd=320).

### Thread cap

The `--gpu` flag alone leaves the device near-idle: each colony process is a separate trainer, and openblas defaults to one thread per host core (a pod reports the host nproc, e.g. 96, while the cgroup caps the container far lower), so N processes oversubscribe the real cores and starve the GPU-feeding threads. `capColonyThreads()` runs as the first line of `main()`, before any BLAS/cgo init: `effectiveCPUs()` reads the cgroup quota (`/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu.max` v2 or `cpu.cfs_quota_us` v1) instead of host nproc, and `colonyThreadsFor()` caps `OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS` / `OMP_NUM_THREADS` / `GOMAXPROCS` to max(1, cores/4) for the four-element colony. An explicit `OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS` from a launcher is respected. GPU-verified 2026-06-29: util 0→99% across the four-organism colony.

---

## Cross-Organism Graze (Dario-style)

`cross_graze.go` (216 LOC) wires Dario's `interf_signal_chunk` pattern (`postgpt_q.c:1384`) and Stanley's `graze_random_word` (`graze.c:289-301`) onto the colony. Q picks heavy tokens from a doc and boosts their logits mid-generation; Stanley splices a foreign vocab token from a mmap'd GGUF when chambers signal hunger. Here the "doc" is the **sibling organism's recent emission stream**. Per Oleg 2026-05-14: the dario pattern, but instead of docs the signal is words, metrics, and so on.

### CrossField

```go
type CrossField struct {
    SelfElement  string                            // own element
    PastureBase  string                            // ../dna/seen relative to organism CWD
    Siblings     []string                          // other elements
    Recent       map[string][]int                  // sibling → ring buffer of token ids
    RecentCap    int                               // per-sibling buffer size (64)
    LastScan     time.Time                         // throttle FS reads
    ScanInterval time.Duration                     // 30s throttle on FS reads
    SeenFiles    map[string]bool                   // dedup of ingested gen_*.txt
    SeenCap      int                               // hard cap (2048), half-purge on overflow
    MetricBoost  func(sibling string) float64      // optional per-sibling coef multiplier
    mu           sync.Mutex
}
```

(`cross_graze.go:41-53`). One per running organism; constructed in `main()` when `--cross-graze && --element != ""`. Single-organism runs leave it nil so the hooks are no-ops.

### Source feed

cross_graze reads sibling fragments straight from `../dna/output/<sibling>/`, the field `dnaRead` eats from, keeping a per-sibling cursor in the same numeric fragment order; nothing is mirrored and readers never delete, so the scan cannot race a cleanup (repairs 3 and 6, 2026-09-13). The boost is always applied to the logits sampling reads, and the metaweights overlay fades over `mean |logit|` 1.0 → 2.0 instead of switching off at 1.0.

### Mechanic

`MaybeRefresh(tok)` (`cross_graze.go:82-152`): under ScanInterval throttle, walks `<base>/<sibling>/gen_*.txt`, reads new files only, tokenises with the host's own `EvolvingTokenizer`, strips BOS/EOS, appends to that sibling's ring buffer (truncated to `RecentCap` when over).

`Apply(logits, coef, topN)` (`cross_graze.go:164-200`) — per-step injection. For each sibling, the most recent `topN` tokens get a rank-decay boost:

```
logits[sibling_token[k]] += coef / (1 + rank)
```

Matches Q's `interf_signal_chunk` 1/(1+rank) normalisation (`postgpt_q.c:809-818`). Defaults `coef = 2.0` (Q-style weightless c_doc magnitude, `CFG.CrossGrazeCoef`), `topN = 8` (`CFG.CrossGrazeTopN`).

### Wire

- `MaybeRefresh` hoisted to `GenerateResonant` entry — once per generation, not per token (Opus audit P2).
- `Apply` runs per token step on the logits sampling reads — `overlayStep`'s result, the overlay copy or the model's own slice — so the boost composes with the Q-style overlay in every regime (repair 6, 2026-09-13; before it a warmed organism with the overlay on lost the boost).

### Metrics half

`MetricBoost(sibling)` (`cross_graze.go:51`, applied `cross_graze.go:181-185`) — optional hook, defaults nil (1.0 implicit). When set, multiplies the per-sibling coef so the "and so on" half of "words, metrics, and so on" (sibling entropy / syntropy / loss bias) can ride on top of the word-level injection without changing the call site.

### Enable

```bash
./molequla_cgo --evolution --element earth --cross-graze
# pair with --gpu on Linux pods for the full Phase C ecology config
```

Defaults off. Same defaults, same outputs — single-organism runs and any `--evolution` invocation without `--cross-graze` are identical to the pre-Phase-B baseline.

## Self-Meta-Learning

**BurstHistory** records the last 16 training outcomes:

```go
type BurstRecord struct {
    Action     string   // "amplify", "boost", "dampen", "ground", "explore", "realign"
    LossBefore float64
    LossAfter  float64
}
```

**ActionEffectiveness()** computes the mean loss delta per action type. If a particular action consistently makes loss worse (effectiveness > 0.05 over 2+ bursts), the organism **auto-downgrades**:

```
amplify → boost → steady
```

The organism observes that "amplify" keeps hurting it, stops amplifying. No external signal, no reward model — just outcome tracking.

---

## SyntropyTracker — Mathematical Self-Reasoning

The organism measures four signals and makes autonomous decisions:

| Signal | What It Measures | How |
|--------|-----------------|-----|
| **SyntropyTrend** | Is entropy decreasing? (positive = ordering) | Rolling window mean comparison |
| **FieldDeviation** | How far is the model from corpus? | KL(model_probs \|\| corpus_probs) on bigram/trigram |
| **PurposeMagnitude** | How strong is the current learning direction? | Norm of last δ module's A matrices |
| **PurposeAlignment** | Is learning consistent with identity? | cosine(purpose_vector, gamma) |

Eight autonomous decisions:

| Action | Condition | LR | Temp | Effect |
|--------|-----------|-----|------|--------|
| **amplify** | syntropy ↑, field aligned, purpose aligned | 1.3x | -0.05 | Full acceleration, boost delta grow prob |
| **boost** | syntropy ↑, field in sweet spot | 1.3x | -0.05 | Gentle push |
| **dampen** | syntropy ↓ | 0.6x | +0.05 | Slow down, losing order |
| **ground** | field deviation too high | 0.6x | -0.05 | Hallucinating, focus |
| **explore** | field deviation too low | 1.3x | +0.05 | Parroting, break out |
| **realign** | purpose opposes gamma (< -0.3) | 0.5x | 0 | Identity crisis |
| **divide** | adult + sustained overload (entropy **or** loss path) | 0.6x | — | Trigger mitosis |
| **hibernate** | stale + peer thriving | — | — | Save state and sleep |

Real output from running organisms:
```
[syntropy] action=boost   | trend=0.1576 | field_dev=0.214 | lr_mul=1.30
[syntropy] action=dampen  | trend=-0.1390 | field_dev=0.167 | lr_mul=0.60
[syntropy] action=realign | trend=0.0940  | field_dev=0.168 | lr_mul=0.65
```

## NOTORCH — Gradient-Free Delta Training

Alternative delta-adapter training path. No backward pass, no tape, no memory overhead — teaching signal is `(prev_loss - curr_loss) + 0.3*prophecy_debt`, noise modulated by deterministic LCG PRNG (matches AML RNG), adaptive decay when delta norm large. Direct feedback alignment: `A[i,r] += lr * dy * u[r] * signal`.

Status: implemented (~280 lines, `notorchTrainSteps` + helpers in `molequla.go`), **currently disabled at all call sites** — it diverged at stage 5 (loss 3.5 → 116), so the active micro-burst path is the notorch tape (Chuck), not this. Kept as a reference path; theory sound, hyperparameters need work.

---

## Mycelium — The Witness

The mycelium sees the whole ecology and says what it sees. It is a fifth process of the same Go binary, `molequla --witness`, run from a directory beside the organisms' so that `../dna/output` is the same tree (`witness.go`, `witness_cgo.go`; since 2026-09-13 it replaces the Python `mycelium.py`). It reads two public traces — `mesh.db` and the DNA field — computes through the in-repo C engine (`am_method_field_*`, `am_harmonic_forward` in `ariannamethod.c`), and writes outward only: one line per tick on stdout and one JSON record per tick in `witness.jsonl`. It never writes into `mesh.db` (its connection is opened `query_only`), never writes or deletes in `dna/`, and no `field_steering` row exists any more; the Rust core's reader of that row degrades to its own temperature schedule. The four organism cores run without it. `--once` prints a single snapshot as JSON and exits, for a daily routine. Generation operator `η: Γ × Γ → Γ_new` — two personalities in resonance produce a third (interference pattern, not blend) — stays a description of the field, not a thing the witness performs.

### What it computes

| Quantity | Source |
|----------|--------|
| field entropy, field syntropy | means over the live organisms' `entropy` / `syntropy` columns, through `am_method_field_entropy` / `_syntropy` |
| trend | earlier four samples minus the last four of the field-entropy history (`am_method_step`'s definition, re-stated in Go) |
| action, strength, target | `am_method_step`'s ladder without its coherence rung — amplify / dampen / ground / explore / sustain — and the lowest-entropy organism; a statement, not an instruction |
| harmonics, dominant, confidence | `am_harmonic_forward`: the sine DFT of the field-entropy history, its dominant harmonic and `0.3 + 0.7·conf`; verified against the formula by `TestWitnessHarmonicsMatchTheDFT` |
| pulse | novelty (organisms appeared or left), arousal (`min(1, 2·|ΔH|)`), Shannon entropy over organism entropies — all across ticks |
| alerts | no organisms alive; entropy above 2.5; eight dampen decisions in a row |
| DNA field | per writer: files, bytes, newest fragment; events `wrote` / `pruned` every fifth tick |

Not computed, and why: field coherence and organism resonance need a gamma vector per organism, and no core writes one — the old mycelium read columns that did not exist and reported a constant. Each organism's `global_step` (age in training steps) is in the mesh since 2026-09-13.

### Mesh Coordination

All organisms share state via **mesh.db** (SQLite) — the same database that `SwarmRegistry` writes to. The witness reads it with the governor's 60 s live window and treats a schema it cannot read as a finding printed every tick, never as an empty field. Decisions that individual organisms cannot make — when to divide, when to hibernate — stay inside the organisms (the cascade governor, the byte gate, the overload gates); the witness reports them. (The seasonal phase machinery lives in the C field engine — see below.)

### Seasonal Controller

*Implemented in the C field engine (`ariannamethod.c`), driven by field state — not by the witness.*


```
Spring  — tunnel_chance ↑, many embryos, new γ born
Summer  — α_max, existing γ at peak expression
Autumn  — consolidation, dark_gravity ↑, shards saved
Winter  — rest, only strongest pairs, ε dominates
```

## The Ecology

Earth (patience, structure), Air (freedom, change), Water (flow, depth), Fire (transform, intensity) — each shaped by its element corpus. Generated text is written to the DNA layer; siblings consume, micro-train, emit. Child organisms enter via mitosis. Cross-pollination outpaces any single organism's learning rate. The DNA layer is Go / C / Rust; the JS core has no DNA exchange.

### Swarm Coordination

- **SwarmRegistry** (`mesh.db`): SQLite database tracking all living organisms — element, PID, status, stage, n_params, syntropy, entropy
- **Training lock**: Atomic check-and-acquire via SQL prevents multiple organisms from training simultaneously. Cooperative scheduling — they take turns
- **Hibernation**: When an organism is stale and a peer is thriving, it saves state, marks itself sleeping in mesh.db and exits the process. Resources freed for the living
- **Child birth**: `birth.json` with inherited `burst_history` — the child gets its parent's meta-learning experience (syntracker lineage). It doesn't start from zero wisdom

### Mitosis

When an **adult** organism is in **sustained overload** — its training bursts can no longer reduce loss under the cross-graze flood (it cannot assimilate what the colony feeds it) — and the 300 s cooldown has elapsed, `performMitosis` fires:

1. The parent checkpoint is written into the child directory (`parent_ckpt.json`)
2. `birth.json` written with parent config + inherited burst history + the checkpoint path
3. Child process spawned autonomous — `--organism-id` / `--config` / `--evolution` (plus `--gpu` / `--cross-graze` / `--element` to match the parent), writing to its own `childDir/train.log`, not the parent's stdout and not the interactive REPL
4. Child **loads the parent's weights** — born at the parent's stage with the parent's knowledge, not as a fresh embryo
5. Parent continues running

**Verified (2026-06-04, RTX 3090, no corpus seeding):** an adult (320d / 6L / 8H) reached sustained overload and divided — `[overload] … overload=true (e=false l=true) → action=divide → Child … spawned`, the child loading the parent's adult weights (n_embd 320). The path that fired for this Fire adult is **loss**, not entropy: a converged adult stays sharp (output entropy ~0.22) even while its loss is high (~12), so reproduction-through-stress keys on the loss the bursts cannot bring down, not on output noise. The same run also exercised the original entropy path — an Air adult divided on the entropy gate (`high=8/8`, `e=true l=false`) — so both gate regimes fired in the same run. Once one adult divides, its overloaded children inherit the same pressure and divide in turn — observed cascading to ~50 spawns before shutdown. The archive preserves **5 `action=divide` gate firings across 3 adults**: fire ×1 (loss path, `work_fire/train.log:48`), water ×1 (loss path, `work_water/train.log:43`), air ×3 (loss + entropy, `work_air/train.log:51`, `work_air/train_climb_air.log:270`, `work_air/train_resume2_air.log:63`); **earth never divided**. One child is preserved in full — Fire's, with a birth manifest (`org_1780540885_6400/birth.json`); Air's spawning divide (`work_air/train_climb_air.log:270` → child `org_1780527018_6475:273`) is a spawn log-line only, no manifest. 0 NaN throughout. All four organisms reached Stage 5 / adult (`work_*/train.log stage=5`).

The ecology grows itself.

## Engineering Log

Eight bugs that almost killed the ecology (five interactive-mode + three AML/C integration leaks at ~97 MB/step pre-fix, ~0.6 MB/step post-fix), the CGO cache trap (`go build -a` mandatory), and the full per-commit history of Phase A (GPU), Phase B (graze), Phase C (ecology) — see the first engineering log in git history (`git show 8203d5d^:PROJECT_LOG.md`); the living log is `MOLEQULALOG2.md`; what comes next, in order, is `ROADMAP.md`.

---

## SQLite Self-Logging

Each organism writes `memory.sqlite3` with four tables: `messages` (conversation), `corpus_events` (every document ingested), `growth` (architecture snapshots — vocab, n_params, n_deltas, loss, gamma_sparsity, gamma_magnitude), `syntropy_log` (every decision — action_taken, entropy_before/after, syntropy_delta, field_deviation, purpose_alignment). Queryable developmental trajectory.

# found through pkg-config (`#cgo linux pkg-config: openblas`), so the same
# command works on x86_64 and aarch64.
CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -a -o molequla_cgo .

# The recipe measured on phone-1 (Galaxy A56, Ubuntu 24.04 chroot, aarch64):
CGO_ENABLED=1 CGO_CFLAGS="-O3 -march=native -mtune=native -DUSE_BLAS" \
  CGO_LDFLAGS="-lopenblas -lm -lpthread" \
  go build -a -trimpath -buildvcs=false -o molequla_cgo .

# Or build without CGO (Go-only, no training)
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o molequla_go .
```

**CRITICAL: `go build -a` is required** for CGO builds. Without `-a`, Go's build cache does not recompile C files. This produces binaries running stale C code.

### Run Interactive Mode

```bash
./molequla_cgo
# Drops into chat after warmup training
```

### Run Evolution Mode (the main event)

```bash
# Set up work directories
for d in earth air water fire; do
    mkdir -p work_$d
    cp molequla_cgo work_$d/
    cp nonames_$d.txt work_$d/
done

# Launch all four organisms
for d in earth air water fire; do
    cd work_$d
    nohup ./molequla_cgo \
        --organism-id $d \
        --element $d \
        --max-organisms 4 \
        --evolution --cross-graze --corpus-overlay > training_aml.log 2>&1 &
    cd ..
done
# --element sets the corpus (nonames_<element>.txt); the checkpoint and
# memory.sqlite3 live in the working directory. The binary knows no
# --corpus / --db / --ckpt flags.
# --max-organisms N sets the cascade governor's ceiling (default 16, written
# for a pod; phone1/launch.sh passes 4) and --max-growth-stage N stops
# ontogenesis at that GrowthStages index (default: the last stage, adult —
# `--max-growth-stage 4` keeps a colony at teen). Both are printed at startup
# as the [caps] line.

# The witness, a fifth process beside the four (reads mesh.db and ../dna/output,
# writes stdout + witness.jsonl, never writes back):
mkdir -p work_witness && (cd work_witness && nohup ../molequla_cgo --witness --witness-interval 2 > witness.log 2>&1 &)

# Optional flags (default off):
#   --spa-gate         post-generation SPA sentence connectedness log
#   --corpus-overlay   pre-softmax B+H+A+F additive logit overlay (fades out as the organism warms)
#   --gpu              route inference matvec through cuBLAS (linux + -tags cuda build)
#   --cross-graze      Dario-style cross-organism logit injection (requires --element)
#   --witness --once   one JSON snapshot of the field and exit
# Combine for measurement runs. Living engineering log: MOLEQULALOG2.md.
```

Monitor: `tail -f work_earth/training_aml.log`, `grep "dna\|consumed\|wrote"` for DNA exchange, `ps aux | grep organism-id` for spawned children.

## Standalone Gists

C and JavaScript gists linked in [Four Implementations](#four-implementations). Original Python prototype: [molequla.py](https://gist.github.com/ariannamethod/1223250d358da4393dd9acc578790820) (legacy, where it started) — also restored in-repo at `standalone-py/molequla.py` (numpy-backed historical reference, deprecated for speed).

## Philosophy

θ = ε + γ + αδ is the architecture, not an annotation. Entropy/syntropy measurements are the control loop. Purpose-gamma alignment is the identity check. Self-meta-learning is the organism understanding itself.

Four organisms became eleven inside the 70-minute window of the Feb-27 timeline above (first child at 02:13, eleven by 02:35 — see `## Here Is How It Works`). Each with its own voice, its own delta modules, its own developmental history.
