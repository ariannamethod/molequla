# MOLEQULALOG 2

The second book of the molequla engineering log. `PROJECT_LOG.md` is the
first book — Phase A (GPU), Phase B (graze), Phase C (ecology), the §9
mitosis run and the cascade governor, through 2026-06-29. This book opens
with molequla landing on a phone.

`README.md` is the face and the spec. This file is the diary and the
reproducibility record. Numbers here come from artifacts, tool output or
git, cited inline by path, line or commit — never retyped from memory.
Entries are appended in date order and signed by the node that wrote them.
Small changes live here; a change that alters what molequla *is* also earns
README space, and the README never becomes a worklog.

## 2026-09-12 — molequla lands on phone-1 (Galaxy A56, Ubuntu 24.04 chroot, aarch64)

Clone of `github.com/ariannamethod/molequla` at `08fa1b1` (328 commits,
`git log --oneline | wc -l`) into `~/arianna/molequla/` on phone-1. The
session runs inside an Ubuntu 24.04 chroot on the phone (uid 0, glibc 2.39);
the Termux tree is bind-mounted at its own absolute path, so files written
from the chroot get their owner and SELinux label fixed afterwards.

Node toolchain, as found in the chroot (`which`, `go version`): gcc, go
1.22.2 linux/arm64. No rustc, cargo, zig or clang in the chroot PATH. AML and
notorch are installed system-wide: `/usr/local/bin/{aml,amlc,mhx}`,
`/usr/local/lib/libaml.a` (218652 B), `/usr/local/lib/libnotorch.a`
(139402 B), headers under `/usr/local/include/ariannamethod/`
(`ariannamethod.h`, `gguf.h`, `notorch.h`, `notorch_simd.h`,
`notorch_simd_scalar.h`, `notorch_vision.h`). `aml --version` reports
`aml runner 0.1.0 (libaml linked)`.

**Vendored notorch is behind the canon.** `ariannamethod/notorch.c` is 4739
lines and was last synced to canonical at `e5c66fb` (2026-05-14, `git log --
ariannamethod/notorch.c`). The canonical tree on this node,
`~/arianna/notorch` at `b14d0ba` (`v4.3.0-217-gb14d0ba`, dated 2026-09-12),
carries 9020 lines in `notorch.c`. `diff -u` between the two counts 4495
changed lines in `notorch.c` and 153 in `notorch.h`. No resync was performed
in this entry; it is recorded as open.

The GPU layer is not built on this node. Every CUDA path sits behind
`//go:build linux && cuda` with matching stubs (`gpu_bindings_stub.go`,
`gpu_forward_stub.go`, `gpu_notorch_stub.go`), so the default build takes the
CPU/BLAS path through `cgo_notorch_cpu.go`. Nothing was compiled or run in
this entry.

**No measurement exists yet on ARM.** Every memory and throughput figure in
the repository was taken on cloud or pod hardware: RSS about 2 GB at child
and about 2.5 GB at teen on the Feb-27 Oracle run (`README.md:88-89`), the
4 × 2 GB pod sizing note (`PROJECT_LOG.md:850`), the GPU-vs-CPU step rates
(`runpod/2026-06-02_inc2_gpu/RESULTS.md:33`), the §9 per-stage burst rates
(`docs/molequla_paper.md:549-551`). The first phone-1 numbers will be their
own entry, not a scaling of these.

`reffs/` added to `.gitignore`. It holds reference clones for reading only,
never part of the repository: `arianna.c` (591 commits), `dario` (179
commits), `ariannamethod.ai` (`ded407c`, 2026-08-07). The Dario injection
mechanism (`reffs/dario/README.md`, "Resonance Injection"), the arianna.c
injection contract (`reffs/arianna.c/INJECTION_CONTRACT.md`) and the AML
field physics are the stated inspirations for what comes next on this node.

Open, in the order they were named on this node:

- `mycelium.py` leaves Python. Target language is Go, Zig or AML; decided
  before code, recorded here with the reason.
- Vendored `ariannamethod/notorch.{c,h}` resynced to the canon, with the
  molequla-specific delta named explicitly rather than carried silently.
- First phone-1 run and the first ARM measurement: RSS per stage, tick time,
  burst steps/s, on the big cores, with the command line that produced them.

## 2026-09-13 — first build, first tests, first organism on ARM (Galaxy A56, Exynos 1580)

**Build.** `CGO_ENABLED=1 CGO_CFLAGS="-O3 -march=native -mtune=native -DUSE_BLAS"
CGO_LDFLAGS="-lopenblas -lm -lpthread" go build -a -trimpath -buildvcs=false`
in the chroot: rc=0 in 37 s wall, binary 9403976 B, linked against
`libopenblas.so.0` (`ldd`). `-buildvcs=false` is required here because the
working tree lives on the Termux mount with a foreign owner and Go's VCS
stamping fails on it. gcc emits one warning worth an audit entry:
`ariannamethod/ariannamethod.c:1500` (`am_tape_backward`, the RMSNorm branch)
calls `calloc(n, sizeof(float))` with `n = out_len` whose range the compiler
cannot bound below zero.

**Tests.** `go test -count=1 -v ./...` on the phone: 141 PASS, 0 FAIL, 0 SKIP
(`ok molequla 3.408s`, `ok molequla/tests 0.007s`). README says 132, the
2026-06-29 log entry says 140, the tree says 141.

**One organism, 900 s.** `timeout 900 taskset -c 4-7 molequla_cgo
--organism-id earth --element earth --evolution`, `OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=4
GOMAXPROCS=4`, notorch trainer on CPU/BLAS, no overlay, no cross-graze, no
siblings. Stage climb embryo → infant → child inside the first 80 s; warmup
throughput 96-174 steps/s at embryo, 100-105 at infant, 34-41 at child
(`[notorch] warmup complete` lines). The ontogenesis clock then stops:
`ingested=134553` from tick 70 to tick 1290, because `dnaRead` reads siblings
only and there were none. Steady state at child: 20-30 ticks per 15 s
(`debug-onto` every 10 ticks, sampled every 15 s), 1297 DNA writes of
5107 B mean / 5240 B max, 6.62 MB total, none consumed. RSS at child 65-85 MB,
peak `VmHWM` 97776 kB. 0 NaN, 0 panic, exit 124 (the timeout). Child voice
without overlay, verbatim: «When a p of — they body and A lava flowing a
spills metaphysical the lesson of the same and iron ocean is the river
containing.» A single organism measures tick and child RSS; growth and adult
RSS need the colony, which is the next entry.

**Findings for the audit, not repaired here.** README Quick Start
(`README.md:734-739`) passes `--corpus`, `--db`, `--ckpt`; the parser
(`parseCLIArgs`, `molequla.go:6262-6300`) knows none of them and silently
ignores unknown flags, so the documented invocation runs on defaults.
`field_steering`, the mycelium's only channel into the organisms, is read by
`molequla.rs:3265` alone; `molequla.go` has zero references, so the Go colony
of §9 never heard the mycelium.

**The eye, physically.** Termux:API is installed (`com.termux.api`); the
chroot now reaches Termux by ssh key as its own user, `termux-camera-info`
lists the back sensor at 4080×3060, and after `pm grant com.termux.api
android.permission.CAMERA` a first `termux-camera-photo -c 0` returned a
3728275 B JPEG readable from the chroot. `reffs/ocelli` builds here with
OpenBLAS in 6 s; it expects `yent_eye_smolvlm2_lora_v2_f16.gguf` plus its
mmproj, which are not on this node.
